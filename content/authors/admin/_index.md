I like to build web applications for interactive data visualization and data analysis. I use many tools to accomplish this (e.g. R,  Shiny, Javascript, Svelte, Mapbox, Mapbox GL, pancake.js, QGIS) and often work with spatial data. I am a skilled R programmer with experience building R packages, cleaning/tidying data and managing/creating SQLite and PostgreSQL databases.

Outside of my consulting work, I am a PhD student in the Freshwater Fish Ecology lab at University of Northern British Columbia. My research involves the use of Bayesian inference to study fish movement from acoustic telemetry data.
